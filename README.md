# walthamstow.me

http://walthamstow.me/ is a test / MVP. It's currently implemented as a Google Doc.

The recommended Google Analytics practice is to embed the gDoc in a page, and put tracking code (and I suppose other HTML goodies) in the page.
So, this is a simple wrapper implemented as a GitHub page.

According to https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/ the URL should be http://johnfield.github.io/walthamstow.me - but it seems to be http://johnfield.london/walthamstow.me/ as I'm using a custom domain.  

Obviously, a more sophisticated setup (wiki?) can be put in place if the MVP takes off...
