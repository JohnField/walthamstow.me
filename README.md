# walthamstow.me

http://walthamstow.me/ is a test / MVP. It's currently implemented as a Google Doc.

The recommended Google Analytics practice is to embed the gDoc in a page, and put tracking code (and I suppose other HTML goodies) in the page.
So, this is a simple wrapper implemented as a GitHub page.

Obviously, a more sophisticated setup (wiki?) can be put in place if the MVP takes off...
